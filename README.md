# Threatsalert

 I have created a project that involves building a web scraper to collect Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) data, and 
 developing a website using Flask and Semantic-UI to present this information to users. The website enables users to view the vulnerabilities 
 associated with the software they use.
